  description: |
    Machine learning can significantly improve performance for decision-making under uncertainty in a wide range of domains. However, ensuring robustness guarantees requires well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, which can be difficult to achieve with neural networks. Moreover, in high-dimensional settings, there may be many valid uncertainty estimates, each with their own performance profile—_i.e._, not all uncertainty is equally valuable for downstream decision-making. To address this problem, we develop an end-to-end framework to _learn_ uncertainty sets for conditional robust optimization in a way that is informed by the downstream decision-making loss, with robustness and calibration guarantees provided by conformal prediction. In addition, we propose to represent general convex uncertainty sets with partially input-convex neural networks (PICNNs), which are learned as part of our framework. Our approach consistently improves upon two-stage estimate-then-optimize baselines on concrete applications in energy storage arbitrage and portfolio optimization.

    SustainGym: Reinforcement Learning Environments for Sustainable Energy Systems
  setting: Caltech, 2022 - 2023
  thumbnail: project_2022_research_sustaingym.png
  description: |
    The lack of standardized benchmarks for reinforcement learning (RL) in sustainability applications has made it difficult to both track progress on specific domains and identify bottlenecks for researchers to focus their efforts. In this paper, we present SustainGym, a suite of five environments designed to test the performance of RL algorithms on realistic sustainable energy system tasks, ranging from electric vehicle charging to carbon-aware data center job scheduling. The environments test RL algorithms under realistic distribution shifts as well as in multi-agent settings. We show that standard off-the-shelf RL algorithms leave significant room for improving performance and highlight the challenges ahead for introducing RL to real-world sustainability tasks.

    Online learning for robust voltage control under uncertain grid topology
  setting: Caltech, 2022 - 2024
  thumbnail: project_2022_research_voltctrl.png
  thumbnail_caption: Our voltage control method combines a consistent model chasing algorithm with a robust control oracle to achieve a finite-mistake guarantee even when the distribution grid topology is unknown.
  description: |
    Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid’s topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.

    SustainBench: Benchmarks for Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Machine Learning
  setting: Caltech, 2020 - 2021
  thumbnail: project_2021_research_sustainbench.png
  description: |
    Progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been hindered by a lack of data on key environmental and socioeconomic indicators, which historically have come from ground surveys with sparse temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to utilize abundant, frequently-updated, and globally available data, such as from satellites or social media, to provide insights into progress toward SDGs. Despite promising early results, approaches to using such data for SDG measurement thus far have largely evaluated on different datasets or used inconsistent evaluation metrics, making it hard to understand whether performance is improving and where additional research would be most fruitful. Furthermore, processing satellite and ground survey data requires domain knowledge that many in the machine learning community lack. In this paper, we introduce SustainBench, a collection of 15 benchmark tasks across 7 SDGs, including tasks related to economic development, agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation, climate action, and life on land. Datasets for 11 of the 15 tasks are released publicly for the first time. Our goals for SustainBench are to (1) lower the barriers to entry for the machine learning community to contribute to measuring and achieving the SDGs; (2) provide standard benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models on tasks across a variety of SDGs; and (3) encourage the development of novel machine learning methods where improved model performance facilitates progress towards the SDGs.

    Selection via Proxy: Efficient Data Selection for Deep Learning
  setting: Stanford University, Summer 2018 - 2019
  thumbnail: project_2018_research_svp.png
  thumbnail_caption: In both active learning and core-set selection settings, our "selection via proxy" approach uses a smaller proxy model to select data for a larger target model.
  description: |
    Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, are useful tools for machine learning on large datasets. However, they can be prohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning because they depend on feature representations that need to be learned. We show that we can greatly improve the computational efficiency by using a small proxy model to perform data selection (*e.g.*, selecting data points to label for active learning). By removing hidden layers from the target model, using smaller architectures, and training for fewer epochs, we create proxies that are an order of magnitude faster to train. Although these small proxy models have higher error rates, we find that they empirically provide useful signals for data selection. We evaluate this "selection via proxy" (SVP) approach on several data selection tasks across five datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, Amazon Review Polarity, and Amazon Review Full. For active learning, applying SVP can give an order of magnitude improvement in data selection runtime (*i.e.*, the time it takes to repeatedly train and select points) without significantly increasing the final error (often within 0.1%). For core-set selection on CIFAR10, proxies that are over 10x faster to train than their larger, more accurate targets can remove up to 50% of the data without harming the final accuracy of the target, leading to a 1.6x end-to-end training time improvement.

  title: Deep learning for understanding economic well-being in Africa from publicly available satellite imagery
  setting: Stanford University, Sustainability and AI Lab, Summer 2017 - 2020
  thumbnail: project_2017_research_poverty.jpg
  thumbnail_caption: Nighttime light satellite imagery provides valuable information about economic development.
  description: |
    Accurate and comprehensive measurements of economic well-being are fundamental inputs into both research and policy, but such measures are unavailable at a local level in many parts of the world. We train deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across ~20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral daytime and nightlight satellite imagery with broad temporal and spatial coverage. Models are able to explain 70% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery. Comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Validating estimates of temporal changes in wealth across ~1,500 villages is also hampered by noise in training data, but district-aggregated satellite-based estimates explain up to 50% of the variation in ground-estimated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task. We quantitatively demonstrate the utility of satellite-based estimates for research and policy, and demonstrate their scalability by creating a wealth map for Africa's most populous country.

  description: Various algorithms have been developed over the past two decades for solving the stereo correspondence problem, which is defined as the identification of the offset or disparity of an object in a pair of stereo images. Recent work has shown that conditional random fields (CRFs) have the potential to be faster and more accurate than traditional local matching algorithms. The canonical CRF for solving dense stereo matching problems uses a basic energy function that accounts for both local intensity matching and smoothness costs. Traditionally, the smoothness term relies on a binary Potts Model which fails to assign different costs to different disparities. In this paper, we extend the smoothness term in the energy function to be more robust. Specifically, we explore using a logarithmic function modulated by discrete edge gradient bins and binary edge detection features. The logarithmic function is able to distinguish between different disparities and therefore assign more appropriate costs. Our results suggest that our algorithm exceeds the performance of the traditional smoothness term based on a Potts Model. However, further optimization in our CRF evaluation process is necessary to achieve real-time outputs.

  description: Foam fractionation is an inexpensive and simple technique for concentrating proteins. The foamability of a protein can drastically change with the age of the protein. The foamability of solutions created from ten year old bovine lactoferrin (bLF) protein was investigated with varying concentration protein, air flow velocity, and the pH of the solution. The results suggest the foamability of the aged protein decreased to an insignificant level except at high pH with a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.

    Millions of copyrighted photographs and other visual works are uploaded to the Internet daily without permission from copyright owners. In democratizing the creation and distribution of visual works, digital technologies have also transformed the landscape that effectively defines creators' rights and consumers' ability to track ownership information. The Stanford Law School and U.S. Copyright Office sought to address the limited licensing options and high transaction costs of existing solutions which act as barriers to lawful, licensed uses of photographs or other images.

    Through [Stanford Code the Change](https://codethechange.stanford.edu/), I led a student team to create a prototype web application that simplifies the process of creating and purchasing licenses for copyrighted photos and images. For this project, I used Python, Flask, and SQL, and then deployed the app to Heroku. Our proof-of-concept web app was included as part of a report submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office.
