I am a first-year PhD student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [<span class="caltech-orange">Caltech</span>](https://cms.caltech.edu/), advised by professors Yisong Yue and Adam Wierman. My research is in statistical machine learning, motivated by applications in sustainability.

Previously, I studied Computer Science at [<span class="cardinal-red">Stanford</span>](https://cs.stanford.edu/) where I was a member of the [Sustainability and AI Lab](https://sustain.stanford.edu/) and president of [Code the Change](https://codethechange.stanford.edu/). I also spent a year studying public policy as a [<span class="schwarzman-purple">Schwarzman Scholar</span>](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/) at Tsinghua in Beijing.
