I am a final-year PhD candidate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at [<span class="caltech-orange">Caltech</span>](https://cms.caltech.edu/), where I develop AI algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty with applications in energy, sustainability, and science. I am advised by professors [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/), and my research is generously supported by the Caltech [Resnick Sustainability Institute](https://resnick.caltech.edu/people/christopher-yeh) and the [Quad Fellowship](https://www.quadfellowship.org/2025-fellows/christopher-yeh). I have also been supported by a [Caltech AI4Science/Amazon AWS Fellowship](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors).

Previously, I studied Computer Science at [<span class="cardinal-red">Stanford</span>](https://cs.stanford.edu/) where I was a member of the [Sustainability and AI Lab](https://web.archive.org/web/20240516012949/https://sustain.stanford.edu/) and served as president of [Code the Change](https://codethechange.stanford.edu/). I also spent a year studying global affairs as a [<span class="schwarzman-purple">Schwarzman Scholar</span>](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/) at Tsinghua in Beijing.
