This blog post about my `.vimrc` settings is mainly for personal reference, but I thought I'd make it public in case anyone else was interested. I plan on keeping this post updated if I ever change my `.vimrc` configuration.

Some helpful websites that I've found are listed here:

My `.vimrc` file is also hosted as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisyeh96/5d4479dee77e4b04786e9bc71f43967c).
